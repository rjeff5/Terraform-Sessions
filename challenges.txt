1. Create a storage account with the name azuretutorterraform28 and azuretutorterraform29

azuretutorterraform28 --> account needs to have 5 containers with own names
azuretutorterraform29 --> account needs to have 6 containers with own names

Pick the best-option to satisfy the above requirement.
Make sure it is reusable

2. Create a NSG with 5 security rules

Rules to be enabled --> 80 / 443 / 8080 / 22 / 8081

Make sure it is reusable

3. Create two tfvars files (dev.tfvars /uat.tfvars)

If it is dev environment I need to create the App service plan with F1 tier 
If it is uat environment I need to create the app service plan with B1 tier

Create the tags based on the environment.

Code must be reusable and implement conditional parameters

Once this created create an appservice for both dev and uat and apply lifecycle ignore changes for tags / app settings


4. Create a Resource Group / Storage account - Containers / App service plan / App service 

Main.tf file should be dynamic and not static

Create dev.tfvars / uat.tfvars / prod.tfvars
Create workspace in the name of dev / qat / prod and try to execute each environment seperately so that we can have 3 rg created
App service plan tier --> Free for dev and qa and B1 tier for prod
Account replication type --> LRS for dev / GRS for qa / ZRS for prod
DO NOT USE TERRAFORM.TFVARS for now
Create a variable tf file and declare everything there --> NO values should be present
In your terraform.tf file --> You have to point your state file to be created in a seperate storage account



5. Create a git add commit and push the file
